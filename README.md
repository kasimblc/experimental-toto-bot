# Web-Automator-Bot

An experimental bot written in Python.
This project is a GUI application that performs automatic form filling using Selenium and Tkinter. The project automates the process of filling specific form fields and provides a user-friendly interface. It is currently used to automate form filling and clicking operations on sites such as **nesine.com**.

## Features

- **User Interface (GUI):** Provides an easy-to-use interface for filling out form fields.
- **Automatic Form Filling:** Uses Selenium to perform form filling operations on specific websites, including nesine.com.
- **Click Actions:** In addition to form filling, it performs automatic clicks on specific buttons and links.
- **File Operations:** Handles file management and file encryption tasks.
- **Performance Enhancements:** The application is developed with performance improvement features such as timers and multi-threading. These features are in the experimental phase within the code and are currently inactive. Instead, it uses embedded JavaScript code to provide faster and more efficient processing capabilities. This approach speeds up interactions with web pages and allows for more effective execution of tasks.
- **Logging:** Includes a logging system that records operations.
